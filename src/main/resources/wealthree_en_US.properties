#Provie Plan Details Start#
provie.plandetails.productrisks.title=Key Product Risks
provie.plandetails.risk1.title=<b>Credit Risk</b>
provie.plandetails.risk1.text=This Product is an insurance policy issued by FWD. The application of this insurance product and all benefits payable under your Policy are subject to the credit risk of FWD. You will bear the default risk in the event that FWD is unable to satisfy its financial obligations under this insurance contract.
provie.plandetails.risk2.title=<b>Liquidity Risk</b> 
provie.plandetails.risk2.text=This product is 3 year term insurance policy as determined starting from the policy effective date to the policy maturity date. The Policy contains value and, if you surrender your Policy in the early policy years or before its maturity date, the amount you get back may be considerably less than the total premiums you have paid. Application of the Product may constitute the liquidity risk to your financial condition. You need to bear the liquidity risk associated with the Product.
provie.plandetails.risk3.title=<b>Exchange Rate and Currency Risk</b> 
provie.plandetails.risk3.text= The application of this Product with the policy currency denominated in a foreign currency is subject to that foreign currency\u2019s exchange rate and currency risk. The foreign currency may be subject to the relevant regulatory bodies\u2019 control (for example, exchange restrictions). If your home currency is different from the policy currency, please note that any exchange rate fluctuation between your home currency and the policy currency of this Product will have a direct impact on the amount of premium required and the value of benefit(s) to be received. For instance, if the policy currency of the insurance product depreciates substantially against your home currency, the potential loss arising from such exchange rate movement may have a negative impact on the benefits you receive from this Product and your burden of the premium payment.
provie.plandetails.risk4.title=<b>Inflation Risk</b>
provie.plandetails.risk4.text=The cost of living in the future may be higher than now due to the effects of inflation. Therefore, the benefits under this Policy may not be sufficient for the increasing protection needs in the future even if FWD fulfills all of its contractual obligations. 
provie.plandetails.risk5.title=<b>Early Surrender Risk</b>
provie.plandetails.risk5.text=If you surrender your Policy in the early policy years or before its maturity date, the amount of the benefit you will get back may be considerably less than the total amount of the premiums you paid.
provie.plandetails.term.title=<b>Premium Payment term and non-payment of premium</b>
provie.plandetails.term.text=The premium payment term of the Policy is 2 years. FWD allows a Grace Period of 30 days from the premium due date of the premium for the second Policy Year. If a premium is still unpaid at the expiration of the Grace Period, FWD will forcibly surrender the Policy effective from the date the unpaid premium was due. FWD will pay the Policy Owner the Guaranteed Cash Values less unpaid premiums. Please note that once the Policy is terminated on this basis, you will lose all of your other benefits.
