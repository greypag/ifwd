faq.eliteterm.group1.q1 =What is Term life insurance?
faq.eliteterm.group1.a1=Term life insurance provides pure life insurance protection to the insured for a specific period but does not contain any savings feature. The insurance company will pay the sum assured if death occurs during the covered period. As this plan has no cash value and saving elements, premium for this type of insurance plan is usually the lowest and increase with Insured's age. However, if the insured is still alive at the maturity date of the policy, no proceeds will be provided to the insured by the insurance company.
faq.eliteterm.group1.q2=Why does the customer need Elite Term Plan?
faq.eliteterm.group1.a2=This Plan offers low-cost protection with pure life coverage.  It allows customers to fill his/her protection gap at a relatively low cost.  Moreover, the premiums payable are guaranteed to stay the same for the first twenty policy years. Starting from the 21st policy year, the premiums are not guaranteed which will be determined annually based on factors including but not limited to the age of the Insured at next birthday, claims experience and policy persistency  at the time of renewal. No matter what the customer's state of health is, the Plan continues up to the age of 95.
faq.eliteterm.group1.q3=What is the minimum sum insured and maximum sum insured of Elite Term Plan at i.FWD?
faq.eliteterm.group1.a3=The minimum sum insured is HKD 400,000 and the maximum sum insured is HKD 2,000,000 which is subject to age limit (Insured's age of next birthday) through i.FWD .

faq.eliteterm.group1.a3.li3=Insured age of 56 - 60: maximum sum insured will be HK$0.5 million
faq.eliteterm.group1.q4=What is Advanced Death Benefit?
faq.eliteterm.group1.a4=While the policy is in force and the insured's advent of death is highly likely within 12 months as certified by a registered medical specialist as defined in the policy and is accepted by FWD, the Advanced Death Benefit in the sum equivalent to the Death Benefit will be payable to the policy owner in advance subject to the maximum of HK$1,000,000 per insured.

You will bear the default risk in the event that FWD is unable to satisfy its financial obligations under this insurance contract.</p><br/><p>Liquidity Risk</p><p>This Product is a long term insurance policy. This policy of long term insurance will be made for certain determined term of years starting from the Commencement Date to the Expiry Date.

Therefore, the benefits under this policy may not be sufficient for the increasing protection needs in the future even if FWD fulfils all of the contractual obligations. </p><br/><p>Early Surrender Risk</p><p>If you surrender your policy in the early policy Years or before the end of the policy term, or withdraw the premiums you contributed in the early policy years, you may suffer a significant loss.</p><br/><p>Termination Conditions</p><p>The policy shall terminate on the earliest of the following: 1.
