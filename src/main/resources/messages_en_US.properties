faq.driva.group3.q17 = Why does Drivamatics need confirmation for some of the journeys for public transport?
faq.driva.group3.q18 = Why does the app stop recording automatically after I run the recording process manually?

faq.driva.group4.q27 = What is the \u2018Application enhancement\u2019 in the Drivamatics settings?

faq.driva.group5.q30 = How long will my information be kept?
faq.driva.group5.q31 = If I remove Drivamatics from my mobile handset, does it mean my information is deleted? And does it mean I have unsubscribed from the FWD direct marketing list?
faq.driva.group1.a1 = Drivamatics must detect that you are moving or driving on a journey, before it starts recording. This is why there is a 2-minute difference between the moment you start your journey and the time when the recording begins.
faq.driva.group1.a2 = If you stop moving for 3 minutes and Drivamatics detects it, the system will stop to use the GPS automatically, and the recording will also be stopped. If Drivamatics later detects that you are moving or driving on a journey, the system will start recording again.
faq.driva.group1.a3 = Drivamatics must detect that you are moving or driving on a journey in order to start recording. At that moment, your exact location is already different with the starting point. This is why the journey starting point record is not exactly the same as the actual journey starting point.
faq.driva.group1.a4 = Drivamatics needs the GPS to detect your location and start recording. Therefore you need to keep the GPS turned on all the time.
faq.driva.group1.a5 = Different elements such as buildings and weather can interrupt the GPS from collect location data. So there will be occasional breaks in the tracking record. However, Drivamatics is based on the data of the map, and will try to fill in the breaks whilst tracking. This function starts after you turn on the network data or Wi-Fi connection.
faq.driva.group1.a6 = When your mobile phone cannot receive mobile data or use Wi-Fi (for example, on a train, in a tunnel, or under a bridge), and the GPS may not be able to function, so Drivamatics cannot create a record.
faq.driva.group1.a7 = Whenever Drivamatics detects that you have stopped moving for more than 3 minutes, the system will automatically stop the GPS, and the recording will stop at the same time. So every time you are stationary for more than 3 minutes, the system will end the journey record and start a new one when you get going again.
faq.driva.group1.a8 = You can enter Drivamatics and go to \u201CSettings\u201D, turn on \u201CNotification when auto-record\u201D. When turning on this function, you can receive notification whenever the system starts recording automatically.
faq.driva.group1.a9 = Place your mobile device somewhere stable during your trip.<br/><br/>Drivamatics calculates your score with a precise scientific method. You have to update the app regularly to score accurately. If you have not updated a new version within 30 days after release, the app will stop you from using it and also stop calculating your driving score until you update the app. Your past driving record will not be removed when updating.<br/><br/>Every time a new version is released, a notification will be sent to remind you to update your app, to ensure it runs properly. If, after a week, you still have not updated your app, you will get another notification and so on every week, every time you turn on your app, it will show an update reminder until you do update your app. If you turn off your notification, you may miss the update reminder and your score will no longer be counted.
faq.driva.group1.a10 = Drivamatics calculates your score precisely based on over 40 attributes to evaluate your driving skills. The 5 main elements are safe speed, braking technique, concentration, turning technique and smooth acceleration.
faq.driva.group2.a11 = We do not suggest you to check your journey record when recording, checking your mobile phone whist driving is dangerous. This is why you cannot review your record whilst in the page of recoding mode.
faq.driva.group2.a12 = After the recording is finished, all the data will be uploaded to the server, and then evaluated and scored. Therefore, the latest journey can only be shown in the list after 30 seconds of end of your journey.
faq.driva.group2.a13 = If there is not enough valid data during recriding (for example, when you are driving through a tunnel or under a bridge), the system will not able to evaluate your driving behavior and score. So such trip will be determined as an invalid journey.
faq.driva.group2.a14 = If the recording time is less than 2 minutes, or the distance is less than 1 kilometer, or the location data is not accurate enough, the app will send out one of these notifications.
faq.driva.group2.a15 = The driving scores in the App shall be used  for your reference and for the purpose of enhancing driving pleasure and calculation of MotorSmart Award cash rebate (if applicable) only. The score is an evaluation of your driving technique based on various factors. These scores are for your own interest. They have no legal basis and cannot be used as evidence in any situation.
faq.driva.group3.a16 = The system has to collect more than 300 kilometers worth of data, not less than 10 hours of driving, and not less than 20 trips, to provide a more reliable score. If your journey records have not met the above requirements, then there will be no scoring notification.
faq.driva.group3.a17 = Even though the app can recognize public transport with a high level of accuracy, it cannot reach 100% accuracy. Whenever Drivamatics cannot recognize a particular type of transportation, it will notify you to confirm or amend.
faq.driva.group3.a18 = Whenever Drivamatics detects you are not driving or taking transportation, it will stop recording automatically.
faq.driva.group3.a19 = Drivamatics recognizes the driving \u2018signature\u2019 of all drivers. Whenever it detects a known signature it does not require confirmation. If the app cannot match a new journey with a driver\u2019s past record or signature, it requires confirmation.
faq.driva.group3.a20 = Yes. In the journey list, slide the incorrectly recognized journey title to the left, click the \u2018Journey Reconfirmation\u2019 button and choose the correct journey category from the menu.  A journey can only be changed once.
faq.driva.group3.a21 = Yes. Simply slide the screen to the left, and click \u2018Do not show\u2019. But be careful, once you delete a journey, it will be removed permanently. But the journey will still be counted when evaluating your score.
faq.driva.group4.a22 = Drivamatics is required on your GPS location to collect the data to create your score. So you have to accept Drivamatics using your location information. After you turn on the location information, if Drivamatics is in a stand-by mode, the battery usage shall not be more than 5%.
faq.driva.group4.a23 = On iOS, go to Mobile System setting -> Battery->check the last 24 hours or 7 days battery usage and see the proportion related to Drivamatics. On Android, go to Mobile System setting ->application -> check the battery usage of Drivamatics.
faq.driva.group4.a24.li1 = Allow location service permission
faq.driva.group4.a24.li2 = Turn on a 3G or 4G network
faq.driva.group4.a24.li3 = Turn on backend activity permission, allow background app re-consolidation (this option is not compulsory, but your user experience will be enhanced when you turn it on.)
faq.driva.group4.a25.li1 = During the journey recording process, it\u2019s not necessary to use a mobile network, but it needs mobile network to use the GPS to receive the location signal.
faq.driva.group4.a25.li2 = Yes. When you upload the data, you can simply set it to upload after connecting to Wi-Fi\u2019 in the system setting. This can save your network data usage. But be careful, when you set \u2018Upload journey record only with Wi-Fi\u2019, the system will delay the feedback of the journey recorded. Uploading Data through Wi-Fi is not as good as with a 3G or 4G network.
faq.driva.group4.a26 = You can turn on \u2018Use map only with Wi-Fi\u2019 in the setting and \u2018Upload journey record only with Wi-Fi\u2019 in Drivamatics to save on data usage.
faq.driva.group4.a27 = When you press \u2018Application enhancement\u2019, the system will automatically upload all the information and data of the app to the application programmer, in order to modify your experience and improve the user-orientated interface design.
faq.driva.group5.a28 = We collect your location and trip information simply to evaluate your driving score and for reference. We will not use this record for tracking or monitoring. Also, we collect your information so we can send you new offers, company news and information, as well as direct marketing material. If you want to know more about our personal information usage terms, please refer to the relative terms and condition.
faq.driva.group5.a29 = Please call the FWD 24-hour Service Hotline at 3123 3123. However, once you unsubscribe we will not be able to inform you about our latest offers and important updates.
faq.driva.group5.a30 = In normal circumstances, we will delete your account as well as the information in your account after you stop using Drivamatics for 2 consecutive years (This means if you have not uploaded any driving score to the system in 2 years.)
faq.driva.group5.a31 = No. Even if you remove Drivamatics from your mobile handset, the system will still keep your information, until you stop using Drivamatics for 2 consecutive years (This means you have not uploaded any driving scores to the system for 2 years.)<br/><br/>After 2 years, our company will delete your account as well as all the information in your account. If you do not want us to use your personal information for direct marketing, please call the FWD 24-hour Service Hotline at 3123 3123 to unsubscribe from FWD direct marketing list.
