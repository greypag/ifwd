## Revamp Boundary vs Cost
> 1) Bootstrap classnames are always retrieved higher priority than the one in the FWD BEM CSS
> 2) Some kinds of number will not treat as SASS Variables ( i.e. $xxx )
>  i)  Color
>  ii) Font Style
> 3) The classnames which are related to the JSP and JS in the page, they are probably remained unchange.
> 4) messages_en_US.properties & messages_sh_HK.properties may contains "html tag" with classnames
